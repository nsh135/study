abstract = {Autoencoders play a fundamental role in unsupervised learning and in deep architectures for transfer learning and other tasks. In spite of their fundamental role, only linear au- toencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoen- coder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections},

abstract = {Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response, or RAPPOR, is a technology for crowdsourcing statistics from end-user client software, anonymously, with strong privacy guarantees. In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.},

@article{Bhatnagar2013,
abstract = {Methods for solving a constrained optimization problem in n variables and m constraints can be divided roughly into four categories that depend on the dimension of the space in which the accompanying algorithm works. Primal methods work in n – m space, penalty methods work in n space, dual and cutting plane methods work in m space, and Lagrangian methods work in n + m space. Each of these approaches are founded on different aspects of NLP theory. Nevertheless, there are strong interconnections between them, both in the final form of implementation and in performance. The rates of convergence of most practical algorithms are determined by the structure of the Hessian of the Lagrangian, much like the structure of the Hessian of the objective function determines the rates of convergence for most unconstrained methods. In this appendix, we present several procedures for solving problem (1). The first is the now classical penalty approach developed by Fiacco and McCormick [1968] and is perhaps the simplest to implement. The second is Zoutendijk's feasible direction method. Other primal approaches discussed in the literature include the gradient projection method and the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method that is a simplex-like algorithm. There are many commercial codes that implement these and related techniques. Sequential linear programming and sequential quadratic programming (SQP), for example, are two Lagrangian approaches that have proven to be quite effective. SQP is highlighted at the end of this appendix.},

abstract = { This paper explores the possibility of using multiplicative random projection matrices for privacy preserving distributed data mining. It specifically considers the problem of computing statistical aggregates like the inner product matrix, correlation coefficient matrix, and Euclidean distance matrix from distributed privacy sensitive data possibly owned by multiple parties. This class of problems is directly related to many other data-mining problems such as clustering, principal component analysis, and classification. This paper makes primary contributions on two different grounds. First, it explores independent component analysis as a possible tool for breaching privacy in deterministic multiplicative perturbation-based models such as random orthogonal transformation and random rotation. Then, it proposes an approximate random projection-based technique to improve the level of privacy protection while still preserving certain statistical characteristics of the data. The paper presents extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique is effective and can be successfully used for different types of privacy-preserving data mining applications.},

abstract = {Privacy is becoming an increasingly important issue in many data mining applications. This has triggered the development of many privacy-preserving data mining techniques. A large fraction of them use randomized data distortion techniques to mask the data for preserving the privacy of sensitive data. This methodology attempts to hide the sensitive data by randomly modifying the data values often using additive noise. We question the utility of the random value distortion technique in privacy preservation. We note that random objects (particularly random matrices) have ``predictable'' structures in the spectral domain and it develops a random matrix-based spectral filtering technique to retrieve original data from the dataset distorted by adding random values. We present the theoretical foundation of this filtering method and extensive experimental results to demonstrate that in many cases random data distortion preserve very little data privacy. We also point out possible avenues for the development of new privacy-preserving data mining techniques like exploiting multiplicative and colored noise for preserving privacy in data mining applications.},

@article{Choi2009,
abstract = {This article describes an approach to detecting mental stress using unobtrusive wearable sensors. The approach relies on estimating the state of the autonomic nervous system from an analysis of heart rate variability. Namely, we use a non-linear system identification technique known as principal dynamic modes (PDM) to predict the activation level of the two autonomic branches: sympathetic (i.e. stress-inducing) and parasympathetic (i.e. relaxation-related). We validate the method on a discrimination problem with two psychophysiological conditions, one associated with mental tasks and one induced by relaxation exercises. Our results indicate that PDM features are more stable and less subject-dependent than spectral features, though the latter provide higher classification performance within subjects. When PDM and spectral features are combined, our system discriminates stressful events with a success rate of 83{\%} within subjects (69{\%} between subjects).},

AllSee consumes three to four orders of magnitude lower power than state-of-the-art systems and can enable always-on gesture recognition for smartphones and tablets. It extracts gesture information from existing wireless signals (e.g., TV transmissions), but does not incur the power and computational overheads of prior wireless approaches. We build AllSee prototypes that can recognize gestures on RFID tags and power-harvesting sensors. We also integrate our hardware with an off-the-shelf Nexus S phone and demonstrate gesture recognition in through-the-pocket scenarios.

abstract = {Activity monitoring in home environments has become increasingly important and has the potential to support a broad array of applications including elder care, well-being management, and latchkey child safety. Traditional approaches involve wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This paper presents device-free location-oriented activity identification at home through the use of existing WiFi access points and WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, thermostats, refrigerators, smartTVs, laptops). Our low-cost system takes advantage of the ever more complex web of WiFi links between such devices and the increasingly fine-grained channel state information that can be extracted from such links. It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activities and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accommodate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of different size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96{\%} average true positive rate and less than 1{\%} average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our system can work with wider signal band (802.11ac) with even higher accuracy.},

In order for the biometric system to be more secure and to provide higher accuracy, more than one form of biometrics are required. Hence, the need arise for multimodal biometrics using combinations of different biometric modalities. We describe the design and development of whole hands biometrics prototype system that acquires left and right (L/R) index and ring fingerprints (FP), L/R near-infra-red (NIR) dorsal hand vein (HV) patterns, and L/R NIR dorsal hand geometry (HG) shape. Large database of 500-1000 subjects for whole hands is planned for data collection. The acquired sample images were found to have good quality for all features and patterns extraction to all modalities. The designed prototype can be considered for authentication and identification purposes. Advantages of this system over few existing multimodal systems are its being very hard to spoof attacks on the sensory level and the NIR HV and NIR HG thermal images are good signals for liveness detection.},

Our goal is to allow a group of users to combine enough data to generate useful machine learning models without revealing private infor-mation. In our setting, each peer has a single row of featurized data according to a shared schema, and an aggregator would like to train a binary classification model on the union of all peers' data. Our system horizontally and vertically partitions the set of all peers' data and assembles a differentially-private histogram for each partition. An ensemble classifier can then be trained on the set of noisy partitions. AnonML can be used with or without differentially private data perturbation. Without perturbation, the resulting classifiers achieve performance competitive with centrally-generated models. With local differential privacy, a strong theoretical guarantee, AnonML is capable of producing useful models for practical prediction problems.},

We study secure multiparty addition protocols using well known security schemes: Shamir's secret sharing, perturbation-based, and various encryptions. We supplement our study with our new enhanced encryption scheme EFT, which is efficient and fault tolerant. Differential privacy of the final result is achieved by either distributed Laplace or Geometric mechanism (respectively DLPA or DGPA), while approximated differential privacy is achieved by diluted mechanisms. Distributed random noise is generated collectively by all participants, which draw random variables from one of several distributions: Gamma, Gauss, Geometric, or their diluted versions. We introduce a new distributed privacy mechanism with noise drawn from the Laplace distribution, which achieves smaller redundant noise with efficiency. We compare complexity and security characteristics of the protocols with different differential privacy mechanisms and security schemes. More importantly, we implemented all protocols and present an experimental comparison on their performance and scalability in a real distributed environment. Based on the evaluations, we identify our security scheme and Laplace DLPA as the most efficient for secure distributed data aggregation with differential privacy.},

abstract = {Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response, or RAPPOR, is a technology for crowdsourcing statistics from end-user client software, anonymously, with strong privacy guarantees. In short, RAPPORs allow the forest of client data to be studied, without permitting the possibility of looking at individual trees. By applying randomized response in a novel manner, RAPPOR provides the mechanisms for such collection as well as for efficient, high-utility analysis of the collected data. In particular, RAPPOR permits statistics to be collected on the population of client-side strings with strong privacy guarantees for each client, and without linkability of their reports. This paper describes and motivates RAPPOR, details its differential-privacy and utility guarantees, discusses its practical deployment and properties in the face of different attack models, and, finally, gives results of its application to both synthetic and real-world data.},

Our approach combines both homomorphic encryption and Yao garbled circuits, where each is used in a different part of the algorithm to obtain the best performance.

abstract = {Over the years, iris recognition has gained importance in the biometrics applications and is being used in several large scale nationwide projects. Though iris patterns are unique, they may be affected by external factors such as illumination, camera-eye angle, and sensor interoperability. The presence of contact lens, particularly color cosmetic lens, may also pose a challenge to iris biometrics as it obfuscates the iris patterns and changes the inter and intra-class distributions. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the effect of contact lens on iris recognition performance. We also present the IIIT-D Contact Lens Iris database with over 6500 images pertaining to 101 subjects. For each subject, images are captured without lens, transparent (prescription) lens, and color cosmetic lens (textured) using two different iris sensors. The results computed using VeriEye suggest that color cosmetic lens sigmficantly increases the false rejection at a fixed false acceptance rate. Also, the experiments on four existing lens detection algorithms suggest that incorporating lens detection helps in maintaining the iris recognition performance. However further research is required to build sophisticated lens detection algorithm that can improve iris recognition. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

ML is now pervasive---new systems and models are being deployed in every domain imaginable, leading to rapid and widespread deployment of software based inference and decision making. There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems, yet the technical community's understanding of the nature and extent of these vulnerabilities remains limited. We systematize recent findings on ML security and privacy, focusing on attacks identified on these systems and defenses crafted to date. We articulate a comprehensive threat model for ML, and categorize attacks and defenses within an adversarial framework. Key insights resulting from works both in the ML and security communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We conclude by formally exploring the opposing relationship between model accuracy and resilience to adversarial manipulation. Through these explorations, we show that there are (possibly unavoidable) tensions between model complexity, accuracy, and resilience that must be calibrated for the environments in which they will be used.},

abstract = {Differential privacy promises to enable general data analytics while protecting individual privacy, but existing differential privacy mechanisms do not support the wide variety of features and databases used in real-world SQL-based analytics systems. This paper presents the first practical approach for differential privacy of SQL queries. Using 8.1 million real-world queries, we conduct an empirical study to determine the requirements for practical differential privacy, and discuss limitations of previous approaches in light of these requirements. To meet these requirements we propose elastic sensitivity, a novel method for approximating the local sensitivity of queries with general equijoins. We prove that elastic sensitivity is an upper bound on local sensitivity and can therefore be used to enforce differential privacy using any local sensitivity-based mechanism. We build FLEX, a practical end-to-end system to enforce differential privacy for SQL queries using elastic sensitivity. We demonstrate that FLEX is compatible with any existing database, can enforce differential privacy for real-world SQL queries, and incurs negligible (0.03{\%}) performance overhead.},

Though traditional activity recognition methods have been demonstrated to be effective in previous work, they raise some concerns such as privacy, energy consumption and deployment cost. In recent years, a new activity recognition approach, which takes advantage of body attenuation and/or channel fading of wireless radio, has been proposed. Compared with traditional activity recognition methods, radio based methods utilize wireless transceivers in environments as infrastructure, exploit radio communication characters to achieve high recognition accuracy, reduce energy cost and preserve user׳s privacy. In this paper, we divide radio based methods into four categories: ZigBee radio based activity recognition, WiFi radio based activity recognition, RFID radio based activity recognition, and other radio based activity recognition. Some existing work in each category is introduced and reviewed in detail. Then, we compare some representative methods to show their advantages and disadvantages. At last, we point out some future research directions of this new research topic.},

In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy. 1},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples resulting from adding small-magnitude perturbations to inputs. Such adversarial examples can mislead DNNs to produce adversary-selected results. Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but how to produce them with high perceptual quality and more efficiently requires more research efforts. In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. For AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial perturbations efficiently for any instance, so as to potentially accelerate adversarial training as defenses. We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to traditional white-box attacks. In black-box attacks, we dynamically train a distilled model for the black-box model and optimize the generator accordingly. Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different target models have high attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared to other attacks. Our attack has placed the first with 92.76{\%} accuracy on a public MNIST black-box attack challenge.},

For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution. It requires less adversarial information and can fool more types of networks. The results show that 70.97{\%} of the natural images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 97.47{\%} confidence on average. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks.},

abstract = {Cloud computing helps reduce costs, increase business agility and deploy solutions with a high return on investment for many types of applications. However, data security is of premium importance to many users and often restrains their adoption of cloud technologies. Various approaches, i.e., data encryption, anonymization, replication and verification, help enforce different facets of data security. Secret sharing is a particularly interesting cryptographic technique. Its most advanced variants indeed simultaneously enforce data privacy, availability and integrity, while allowing computation on encrypted data. The aim of this paper is thus to wholly survey secret sharing schemes with respect to data security, data access and costs in the pay-as-you-go paradigm.},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction has been a long-standing research topic in academia and industry for two major reasons. First, in almost every domain, ranging from biology, social science, economics, to military data processing applications, the increasingly large volume of data is challenging the existing computing capability and raising the computing cost. Second, the notion of "intrinsic structure" allows us to remove some redundant dimensions from high-dimensional observations and reduce it into low-dimensional features without significant information loss. Autoencoder, as a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction has been intensively applied in image reconstruction, missing data recovery and classification. In this paper, we propose a new structure, folded autoencoder based on symmetric structure of conventional autoencoder, for dimensionality reduction. The new structure reduces the number of weights to be tuned and thus reduces the computational cost. Simulation results over MNIST data benchmark validate the effectiveness of this structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This technique allows users to ascertain key summary information about the data that is not distorted and does not lead to a security breach. Four bias types have been proposed which assess the effectiveness of such techniques. However, these biases only deal with simple aggregate concepts (averages, etc.) found in the database. To compete in today's business environment, it is critical that organizations utilize data mining approaches to discover additional knowledge about themselves 'hidden' in their databases. Thus, Database Administrators are faced with competing objectives: protection of confidential data versus data disclosure for data mining applications. This paper empirically explores whether data protection provided by perturbation techniques adds a so-called Data Mining Bias to the database. The results find initial support for the existence of this bias.},

abstract = {Data is continuously generated by modern data sources, and a recent challenge in machine learning has been to develop techniques that perform well in an incremental (streaming) setting. In this paper, we investigate the problem of private machine learning, where as common in practice, the data is not given at once, but rather arrives incrementally over time. We introduce the problems of private incremental ERM and private incremental regression where the general goal is to always maintain a good empirical risk minimizer for the history observed under differential privacy. Our first contribution is a generic transformation of private batch ERM mechanisms into private incremental ERM mechanisms, based on a simple idea of invoking the private batch ERM procedure at some regular time intervals. We take this construction as a baseline for comparison. We then provide two mechanisms for the private incremental regression problem. Our first mechanism is based on privately constructing a noisy incremental gradient function, which is then used in a modified projected gradient procedure at every timestep. This mechanism has an excess empirical risk of {\$}\backslashapprox\backslashsqrt{\{}d{\}}{\$}, where {\$}d{\$} is the dimensionality of the data. While from the results of [Bassily et al. 2014] this bound is tight in the worst-case, we show that certain geometric properties of the input and constraint set can be used to derive significantly better results for certain interesting regression problems.},

abstract = {The structure of the majority of modern deep neural networks is characterized by uni- directional feed-forward connectivity across a very large number of layers. By contrast, the architecture of the cortex of vertebrates contains fewer hierarchical levels but many recurrent and feedback connections. Here we show that a small, few-layer artificial neural network that employs feedback will reach top level performance on a standard benchmark task, otherwise only obtained by large feed-forward structures. To achieve this we use feed-forward transfer entropy between neurons to structure feedback connectivity. Transfer entropy can here intuitively be understood as a measure for the relevance of certain pathways in the network, which are then amplified by feedback. Feedback may therefore be key for high network performance in small brain-like architectures.},

abstract = {Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as "teachers" for a "student" model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings. Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.},

@article{Micucci2016,
abstract = {Smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and ad-hoc wearable devices are being increasingly used to monitor human activities. Data acquired by the hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available, would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques. Nowadays, publicly available data sets are few, often contain samples from subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack of specific information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL, the age, the gender, and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different classification tasks: fall vs no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and falls. For each classification task we performed a subject-dependent and independent evaluation. The major findings of the evaluation are the following: i) it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than types of activities; ii) subject-dependent evaluation outperforms the subject-independent one},

Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = p¿q such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A.

Although the data sources are willing to run data mining algorithms in these cases, they do not want to reveal any extra information about their data to other sources due to legal or competition concerns. One possible solution to this problem is to use cryptographic methods. However, the computation and communication complexity of such solutions render them impractical when a large number of data sources are involved. In this paper, we consider a scenario where multiple data sources are willing to run data mining algorithms over the union of their data as long as each data source is guaranteed that its information that does not pertain to another data source will not be revealed. We focus on the classification problem in particular and present an efficient algorithm for building a decision tree over an arbitrary number of distributed sources in a privacy preserving manner using the ID3 algorithm.},

abstract = {A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term "SR image reconstruction" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term "super" in "super resolution" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.},

abstract = {User association logs play an important role in wireless network research. One concern of sharing such logs with other researchers, however, is that they pose potential privacy risks for the network users. Today, the common practice in sanitizing these logs before releasing them to the public is to anonymize users' sensitive information, such as their devices' MAC addresses and their exact association locations. In this work, we aim to study whether such sanitization measures are sufficient to protect user privacy. By simulating an adversary's role, we propose a novel type of correlation attack in which the adversary uses the anonymized association log to build signatures against each user, and when combined with auxiliary information, such signatures can help to identify users within the anonymized log. Using a user association log that contains more than four thousand users and millions of association records, we demonstrate that this attack technique, under certain circumstances, is able to pinpoint the victim's identity exactly with a probability as high as 70{\%}, or narrow it down to a set of 20 candidates with a probability close to 100{\%}.We further evaluate the effectiveness of standard anonymization techniques, including generalization and perturbation, in mitigating correlation attacks; our experimental results reveal only limited success of these methods, suggesting that more thorough treatment is needed when anonymizing wireless user association logs before public release. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recommender systems become increasingly popular and widely applied nowadays. The release of users' private data is required to provide users accurate recommendations, yet this has been shown to put users at risk. Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving methods are either developed under trusted server settings with impractical private recommender systems or lack of strong privacy guarantees. In this paper, we develop the first lightweight and provably private solution for personalized recommendation, under $\backslash$emph{\{}untrusted server{\}} settings. In this novel setting, users' private data is obfuscated before leaving their private devices, giving users greater control on their data and service providers less responsibility on privacy protections. More importantly, our approach enables the existing recommender systems (with no changes needed) to directly use perturbed data, rendering our solution very desirable in practice. We develop our data perturbation approach on $\backslash$emph{\{}differential privacy{\}}, the state-of-the-art privacy model with lightweight computation and strong but provable privacy guarantees. In order to achieve useful and feasible perturbations, we first design a novel $\backslash$emph{\{}relaxed admissible mechanism{\}} enabling the injection of flexible instance-based noises. Using this novel mechanism, our data perturbation approach, incorporating the noise calibration and learning techniques, obtains perturbed user data with both theoretical privacy and utility guarantees. Our empirical evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets not only shows its high recommendation accuracy but also illustrates the negligible computational overhead on both personal computers and smartphones. As such, we are able to meet two contradictory goals, privacy preservation and recommendation accuracy. This practical technology helps to gain user adoption with strong privacy protection and benefit companies with high-quality personalized services on perturbed user data.},

@article{Huang2017,
abstract = {Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand, context-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong privacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic privacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the binary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models, we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics.},

Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks.},

abstract = {Randomization has emerged as a useful technique for data disguising in privacy-preserving data mining. Its privacy properties have been studied in a number of papers. Kargupta et al. challenged the randomization schemes, and they pointed out that randomization might not be able to preserve privacy. However, it is still unclear what factors cause such a security breach, how they affect the privacy preserving property of the randomization, and what kinds of data have higher risk of disclosing their private contents even though they are randomized.We believe that the key factor is the correlations among attributes. We propose two data reconstruction methods that are based on data correlations. One method uses the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, and the other method uses the Bayes Estimate (BE) technique. We have conducted theoretical and experimental analysis on the relationship between data correlations and the amount of private information that can be disclosed based our proposed data reconstructions schemes. Our studies have shown that when the correlations are high, the original data can be reconstructed more accurately, i.e., more private information can be disclosed.To improve privacy, we propose a modified randomization scheme, in which we let the correlation of random noises "similar" to the original data. Our results have shown that the reconstruction accuracy of both PCA-based and BE-based schemes become worse as the similarity increases.},

In this paper, we propose to study the fundamental trade off between the utility of WLAN traces and its privacy. The study provides several realistic case studies in which privacy attacks may be conducted, and questions the efficacy of existing anonymization techniques. Our initial quantitative analysis to estimate mobile users' k-anonymity in WLAN traces shows surprisingly unique usage patterns, which may compromise anonymity. The main contribution of this paper is to articulate the compelling challenges facing anonymization of wireless networks traces and to shed some light on the answer to a most intriguing question: Just how private are wireless network traces?},

We have conducted the experiments on four different datasets, and the results suggest that the proposed approach would not only help in protecting the privacy of data but also in maintaining the quality of data for analysis. To check the robustness of the proposed approach, we have validated the effectiveness of the approach on five key community detection algorithms on three performance measures. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Learning a classifier from private data collected by multiple parties is an important problem that has many potential applications. How can we build an accurate and differentially private global classifier by combining locally-trained classifiers from different parties, without access to any party's private data? We propose to transfer the `knowledge' of the local classifier ensemble by first creating labeled data from auxiliary unlabeled data, and then train a global {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}-differentially private classifier. We show that majority voting is too sensitive and therefore propose a new risk weighted by class probabilities estimated from the ensemble. Relative to a non-private solution, our private solution has a generalization error bounded by {\$}O(\backslashepsilon{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}M{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}){\$} where {\$}M{\$} is the number of parties. This allows strong privacy without performance loss when {\$}M{\$} is large, such as in crowdsensing applications. We demonstrate the performance of our method with realistic tasks of activity recognition, network intrusion detection, and malicious URL detection.},

The flexibility to increase the size of the hidden layer provides a better description of increasingly nonlinear relationships between the known and missing values in the data with a limited loss in generalization ability. The proposed neural network algorithm provides a more accurate estimation of missing values than current matrix completion algorithms based on iterative regression approaches or PCA applications for many datasets with fractions of missing values from 5 to 40{\%}.

abstract = {Machine learning has played an increasing important role in big data systems due to its capability of efficiently discovering valuable knowledge and hidden information. Often times big data such as healthcare systems or financial systems may involve with multiple organizations who may have different privacy policy, and may not explicitly share their data publicly while joint data processing may be a must. Thus, how to share big data among distributed data processing entities while mitigating privacy concerns becomes a challenging problem. Traditional methods rely on cryptographic tools and/or randomization to preserve privacy. Unfortunately, this alone may be inadequate for the emerging big data systems because they are mainly designed for traditional small-scale data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning where the training data are distributed and each shared data portion is of large volume. Specifically, we utilize the data locality property of Apache Hadoop architecture and only a limited number of cryptographic operations at the Reduce() procedures to achieve privacy-preservation. We show that the proposed scheme is secure in the semi-honest model and use extensive simulations to demonstrate its scalability and correctness.},

abstract = {The feature selection addresses the issue of developing accurate models for classification in data mining. The aggregated data collection from distributed environment for feature selection makes the problem of accessing the relevant inputs of individual data records. Preserving the privacy of individual data is often critical issue in distributed data mining. In this paper, it proposes the privacy preservation of individual data for both feature and sub-feature selection based on data mining techniques and fuzzy probabilities. For privacy purpose, each party maintains their privacy as the instruction of data miner with the help of fuzzy probabilities as alias values. The techniques have developed for own database of data miner in distributed network with fuzzy system and also evaluation of sub-feature value included for the processing of data mining task. The feature selection has been explained by existing data mining techniques i.e., gain ratio using fuzzy optimization. The estimation of gain ratio based on the relevant inputs for the feature selection has been evaluated within the expected upper and lower bound of fuzzy data set. It mainly focuses on sub-feature selection with privacy algorithm using fuzzy random variables among different parties in distributed environment. The sub-feature selection is uniquely identified for better class prediction. The algorithm provides the idea of selecting sub-feature using fuzzy probabilities with fuzzy frequency data from data miner's database. The experimental result shows performance of our findings based on real world data set.},

We propose a practical private EM algorithm that overcomes this challenge using two innovations: (1) a novel moment perturbation formulation for differentially private EM (DP-EM), and (2) the use of two recently developed composition methods to bound the privacy "cost" of multiple EM iterations: the moments accountant (MA) and zero-mean concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). Both MA and zCDP bound the moment generating function of the privacy loss random variable and achieve a refined tail bound, which effectively decrease the amount of additive noise. We present empirical results showing the benefits of our approach, as well as similar performance between these two composition methods in the DP-EM setting for Gaussian mixture models.

Numerous methods have been proposed to enforce epsilon-differential privacy in various analytical tasks, e.g., regression analysis. Existing solutions for regression analysis, however, are either limited to non-standard types of regression or unable to produce accurate regression results. Motivated by this, we propose the Functional Mechanism, a differentially private method designed for a large class of optimization-based analyses. The main idea is to enforce epsilon-differential privacy by perturbing the objective function of the optimization problem, rather than its results. As case studies, we apply the functional mechanism to address two most widely used regression models, namely, linear regression and logistic regression. Both theoretical analysis and thorough experimental evaluations show that the functional mechanism is highly effective and efficient, and it significantly outperforms existing solutions.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

@article{Hitaj2017,
abstract = {Deep Learning has recently become hugely popular in machine learning, providing significant improvements in classification accuracy in the presence of highly-structured and large databases. Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning. Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users' private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions, interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem, collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and Shmatikov at CCS'15. Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data). Interestingly, we show that record-level DP applied to the shared parameters of the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP is not designed to address our attack).},

abstract = {The pre-image problem is a challenging research subject pursued by many researchers in machine learning. Kernel-based machines seek some relevant feature in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), optimized in a given sense, such as kernel-PCA algorithms. Operating the latter for denoising requires solving the pre-image problem, i.e. estimating a pattern in the input space whose image in the RKHS is approximately a given feature. Solving the pre-image problem is pioneered by Mika's fixed-point iterative optimization technique. Recent approaches take advantage of prior knowledge provided by the training data, whose coordinates are known in the input space and implicitly in the RKHS, a first step in this direction made by Kwok's algorithm based on multidimensional scaling (MDS). Using such prior knowledge, we propose in this paper a new technique to learn the pre-image, with the elegance that only linear algebra is involved. This is achieved by establishing a coordinate system in the RKHS with an isometry with the input space, i.e. the inner products of training data are preserved using both representations. We suggest representing any feature in this coordinate system, which gives us information regarding its pre-image in the input space. We show that this approach provides a natural pre-image technique in kernel-based machines since, on one hand it involves only linear algebra operations, and on the other it can be written directly using the kernel values, without the need to evaluate distances as with the MDS approach. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated for denoising with kernel-PCA, and compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic datasets and realdata handwritten digits.},

abstract = {Big data has many divergent types of sources, from physical (sensor/IoT) to social and cyber (web) types, rendering it messy and, imprecise, and incomplete. Due to its quantitative (volume and velocity) and qualitative (variety) challenges, big data to the users resembles something like "the elephant to the blind men". It is imperative to enact a major paradigm shift in data mining and learning tools so that information from diversified sources must be integrated together to unravel information hidden in the massive and messy big data, so that, metaphorically speaking, it would let the blind men "see" the elephant. This talk will address yet another vital "V"-paradigm: "Visualization". Visualization tools are meant to supplement (instead of replace) the domain expertise (e.g. a cardiologist) and provide a big picture to help users formulate critical questions and subsequently postulate heuristic and insightful answers. For big data, the curse of high feature dimensionality is causing grave concerns on computational complexity and over-training. In this talk, we shall explore various projection methods for dimension reduction - a prelude to visualization of vectorial and non-vectorial data. A popular visualization tool for unsupervised learning is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA aims at the best recoverability of the original data in the Euclidean Vector Space (EVS). However, PCA is not effective for supervised and collaborative learning environment. Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA), basically a supervised PCA, can be derived via a notion of Canonical Vector Space (CVS). The signal subspace components of DCA are associated with the discriminant distance/power (related to the classification effectiveness) while the noise subspace components of DCA are tightly coupled with the recoverability and/or privacy protection. DCA enjoys two major merits: First, because the rank of the signal subspace is limited by the number of classes, DCA can effectively support classification using a relatively small dimensionality (i.e. high compression). Second, in DCA, the eigenvalues of the noise-space are ordered according to their corresponding reconstruction errors and can thus be used to control recoverability or anti-recoverability by applying respectively an negative or positive ridge. Via DCA, individual data can be highly compressed before being uploaded to the cloud, and thus better enabling privacy protection. In many practical scenarios, additional privacy protection can be incorporated by allowing individual participants to selectively hide some personal features. The classification of masked data calls for a kernel approach to Incomplete Data Analysis (KAIDA). More specifically, we extend PCA/DCA to their kernel variants. The success of kernel machines hinges upon the kernel function adopted to characterize the similarity of pairs of partially-specified vectors. Simulations on the HAR dataset confirm that DCA far outperforms PCA, both in their conventional or kernelized variants. For the latter, the visualization/classification results suggest favorable performance by the proposed partial correlation kernels over the imputed RBF kernel. In addition, the visualization results further points to a potentially promising approach via multiple kernels such as combining an imputed Gaussian RBF kernel and a non-imputed partial correlation kernel.},

abstract = {Given a motion capture sequence, how to i- dentify the category of the motion? Clas- sifying human motions is a critical task in motion editing and synthesizing, for which manual labeling is clearly inefficient for large databases. Here we study the general prob- lem of time series clustering. We propose a novel method of clustering time series that can (a) learn joint temporal dynamics in the data; (b) handle time lags; and (c) produce interpretable features. We achieve this by developing complex-valued linear dynamical systems (CLDS), which include real-valued Kalman filters as a special case; our advan- tage is that the transition matrix is simpler (just diagonal), and the transmission one eas- ier to interpret. We then present Complex- Fit, a novel EM algorithm to learn the pa- rameters for the general model and its special case for clustering. Our approach produces significant improvement in clustering quality, 1.5 to 5 times better than well-known com- petitors on real motion capture sequences},

abstract = {This paper seeks to present a novel computational intelligence technique to generate concise neural network models for distributed dynamic systems. The approach used in this paper is based on artificial neural network architectures that incorporate linear and nonlinear principal component analysis, combined with generalized dimensional analysis. Neural network principal component analysis coupled with generalized dimensional analysis reduces input variable space by about 90{\%} in the modeling of oil reservoirs. Once trained, the computation time is negligible and orders of magnitude faster than any traditional discretisation schemes such as fine-mesh finite difference. Finding the minimum number of input independent variables needed to characterize a system helps in extracting general rules about its behavior, and allows for quick setting of design guidelines, and particularly when evaluating changes in the physical properties of systems. The methodology can be used to simulate dynamical systems characterized by differential equations, in an interactive CAD and optimization providing faster on-line solutions and speeding up design guidelines.},

abstract="Due to the strict energy limitation and the common vulnerability of WSNs, providing efficient and security data gathering in WSNs becomes an essential problem. Compressive data gathering, which is based on the recent breakthroughs in compressive sensing theory, has been proposed as a viable approach for data gathering in WSNs at low communication overhead. Nevertheless, compressive data gathering is susceptible to various attacks due to the open wireless medium. To thwart traffic analysis/flow tracing and realize privacy preservation, this paper proposes a novel Efficient Privacy-Preserving Compressive Data Gathering Scheme which exploits homomorphic encryption functions in compressive data gathering. With homomorphic encryption on the compressive sensing encoded sensory reading messages, the proposed scheme offers two significant privacy-preserving features, message flow untraceability and message content confidentiality, for efficiently thwarting the traffic analysis attacks. Extensive performance evaluations and security analysis demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",
