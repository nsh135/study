\par First, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to my advisor,
Professor J. Morris Chang, for his priceless guidance through my Ph.D. journey over
the last five years. I want to thank Prof. Chang for unconditionally supporting me
with academic knowledge, research instructions, and professional career advice, particularly
guiding me to choose research topics that are among the most interesting in the industry
and academia.

I would also like to sincerely thank the professors on my dissertation committee, Dr. Ismail Uysal, Dr. Xinming Ou, Dr. Lu Lu, and Dr. Zhuo Lu. The knowledge that I
have gained from them during coursework and discussions helped enrich this dissertation.

Last but not least, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my academic friends who have been working around me over the past five years. This dissertation would not have been possible without their help.
