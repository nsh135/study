Deep Learning and its applications have become attractive to a lot of research recently because of its capability to capture important information from large amounts of data. While most of the work focuses on finding the best model parameters, improving the data still needs more attention. In this work, we propose data processing approaches to enhance the robustness of deep learning classification by improving data quality. Specifically, our data processing proposals aim to alleviate the impacts of class-imbalanced data and non-IID data in classification and federated learning scenarios receptively. In addition, data pre-processing strategies such that dimensionality reduction is also enhanced using deep learning-based techniques for a scenario of data privacy preservation. By conducting several experiments and comparisons, we show that our approaches yield good performance and constantly outperform many state-of-the-art methods.
