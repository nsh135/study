\dedication{\par This dissertation is dedicated to my dear family, including my parents, my sister, and her husband. They initiated my Ph.D. journey by encouraging me to go study abroad. They have supported me a lot throughout my entire studying life. Without their endless mental and economic support, I could not have reached this step. 
	
I am also dedicating this to my beloved wife and in-law family members, including my parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, and brothers-in-law. They all mentally supported me a lot and kept encouraging me to overcome difficulties. My wife especially had to give up her dream job to come and help me through my Ph.D. journey. Without their support, this work was not  possible to complete. }
